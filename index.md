## Rental properties in the Boston area

Now that a more significant percentage of the population is getting vaccinated, the pandemic allows us to start leaving our homes.

Some of us may want to invest in rental properties and try to capture some of the dollars that will become available from travelers in the coming months. Many people will start vacationing in many places across the country, including the Boston area.

In order to buy a rental property and try to start a airbnb business in Boston, you may want to answer some basic questions such as:

- What is the expected revenue per day that I can receive from a rental property in that market?
- What is a good level of occupany rate so I can become more profitable?
- What to do to predict rental prices for a small apartment or house that part of the country?

To answer these questions, I took data from Airbnb in Boston, and I provided some insights about the available properties and rental prices of small properties in that area. I also calculated an 'Average Daily Rate' that will indicate the level of revenues that can be expected in that market. I also calculated an 'Occupancy Rate' that will provide some information about the actual occupancy level; indicate the level of market saturation and possible loss of revenue for current property owners.

## Main findings

After cleaning up some rows and columns of unuseful data, I was able to find out that most of the properties in Boston are rented for around $100 and $150 per day. This rates include cleaning fees that must be prorated if the client rent more days.

Another important finding is that people are willing to pay a higher rental fee for apartments with more bathrooms than with more bedrooms. So investor should give a priority to buy properties with more bathrooms than bedrooms. See charts below:

Similarly, occupancy rates are very high or very low. Considering all types of properties (total number 3,268), I found out that 1,254 properties had a very low availability which could indicate that ower prefer to lose some money and keep properties rented. This also may contribute to lower the overall rental rates for Boston.

On the other hand, high availability may indicate that some properties are overprice leading to loss of profitabilities as well. See chart below for details:

Finally, I tried to build a linear regression model to predict price of small properties up to two bedrooms and two bathrooms.
