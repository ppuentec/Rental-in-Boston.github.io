## Rental properties in the Boston area

Now that a more significant percentage of the population is getting vaccinated, the pandemic allows us to start leaving our homes.

Some of us may want to invest in rental properties and try to capture some of the dollars that will become available from travelers in the coming months. Many people will start vacationing in many places across the country, including the Boston area.

In order to buy a rental property and try to start a airbnb business in Boston, you may want to answer some basic questions such as:

- What is the expected revenue per day that I can receive from a rental property in that market?
- What is a good level of occupany rate so I can become more profitable?
- What to do to predict rental prices for a small apartment or house that part of the country?

To answer these questions, I took data from Airbnb in Boston, and I provided some insights about the available properties and rental prices of small properties in that area. I also calculated an 'Average Daily Rate' that will indicate the level of revenues that can be expected in that market. I also calculated an 'Occupancy Rate' that will provide some information about the actual occupancy level; indicate the level of market saturation and possible loss of revenue for current property owners.
